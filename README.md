# ♻️ Smart Waste Classifier

An AI-powered web application that classifies waste as **Organic** or **Recyclable** using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
The project integrates **Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras)** and a **Flask-based web app** for an interactive image upload and prediction interface.
